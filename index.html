      <p>
        My name is Colin Sandman and I'm a senior at the <span class="USC" onclick="window.open('https://sc.edu/','_blank')">University of South Carolina</span>.  
        This May, I'll be launching my career into the Computer Science field and would like to share a few of my projects with you. What you'll find in this portfolio
        website is a sampling of coding that I've completed during my time both at USC and at a gaming incubator called Dolfin Ventures.  My hope is that these projects will 
        allow you to see a glimpse inside what I'm capable of and the passion that I have for the Computer Science industry.

            StudiVerse is a mobile app that was developed as a year-long project for a USC program called Capstone and was my first introduction to mobile app development. This app uses <span style="font-weight:bold" onclick="window.open('https://nodejs.org/en/','_blank')" class="studiverse-list">Node JS</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold" onclick="window.open('https://reactnative.dev/','_blank')" class="studiverse-list">React Native</span> as the framework, with javascript and CSS as coding languages and <span style="font-weight:bold" onclick="window.open('https://firebase.google.com/','_blank')" class="studiverse-list">Firebase</span> as the backend storage database. Conceptually, the focus of StudiVerse was to create a resource for college students to identify tutors, tutor availability, and to access a broader base of needed assistance.

            SandBot is a personal project that I developed using the <span style="font-weight:bold" onclick="window.open('https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/','_blank')" class="sandbot-list">Discord.py</span> framework to create a discord bot for my server. This bot uses moderation commands to moderate the server, give roles to members in the server, and welcome new members into the server. To flesh out SandBot, I learned and utilized the <span style="font-weight:bold" onclick="window.open('https://www.python.org/','_blank')" class="sandbot-list">Python</span> programming language. While this was a challenge, I found the practical application of the language to a real-time project beneficial. SandBot was my first venture into independent developement - it was a great experience, but also helped me identify how much I enjoy collaborative, group projects.

            Dolfin Ventures is a start up incubator located in Beaufort, South Carolina and where I was able to work as a Junior Game Developer between my Junior and Senior year at USC. While there, I was introduced to <span style="font-weight:bold" onclick="window.open('https://unity.com/','_blank')" class="studiverse-list">Unity</span> game engine and <span style="font-weight:bold">C#</span> programming language. I found it extremely satisfying to work in a real-world environment, participate in team meetings and development, and interface with clients.  My work with Dolfin also involved API calls to store data, art department tinterfacing to bring the behind-the-scenes coding to life, weekly deadlines, and what were often pressure situations. To put it mildly, my experience with Dolfin was amazing - it absolutely solidified my passion for the Computer Science industry.

            Criminal Database App was a group project for my software engineering class. It was written in Java and used JSONs to store data in the program as a local database. This project was my first introduction to working collaboratively with multiple people, designating specific tasks to individuals in the group to create the overall program, and working on a longer-term timeline.  The Criminal Database App was designed to be utilized by police ad detectives to add attributes and historical data for criminals in a centralized location.  Data collected could range from height and weight to offense and sentencing, with administrators being able to customize accounts within the app to suit the departments needs.
